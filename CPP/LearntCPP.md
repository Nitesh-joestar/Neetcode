use of math abs function saved me bud

the floyds hare and tortoise algorithm is rlly powerful and interesting
1. [ ] look at floyds hare and tortoise
2. [ ] binary search in finding duplicates
3. [ ] index sort

pigeonhole principle. n+1 array size and n elements. something is repeated.
they used the pigeonhole principle to solve it 
heres how i think the pigeonhole principle is used here in binary search. middle is the element
take the middle element. if the left side of the middle has more elements than right side. left side it is repeated
from there you do binary search.
